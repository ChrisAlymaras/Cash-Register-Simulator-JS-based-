# Cash-Register-Simulator-JS-based-
This is a cash register simulator that calculates change for every different input the customer provides. The project is based in three crucial variables, itemPrice, customerCash, and cid(available denominations).

Futures:
1) Dynamic change caclulation : returns the exact denominations needed for change.
2) Supports pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, ones, fives, tens, twenties, and hundreds.
3) Interactive UI with input field and purchase button.
4) Drawer is updated every time money is given back.

How it works:
1) Enter the cash amount in the input field.
2) Click "Purchase" button.
3) The app returns the calculated change in styled box and updates drawer for the next transaction.

Three available status the drawer shows:
1) INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS when exact change cannot be given or customer's cash exceeds available money in the machine.
2) CLOSED when the drawer is emptied exactly.
3) No change due when the customer pays with exact cash.
